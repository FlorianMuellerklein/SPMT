# Robust Temporal Ensembling with Self Paced Learning for Semi-Supervised Learning

This repo test the addition of self-paced learning to [Robust Temporal Ensembling for Learning with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14563). The goal is increment the line of research to display that robust learning to noisy labels can enhance the self-paced filtering for the unlabeled data within SSL.
